# Team Contract

(Answer each of the following questions. Add anything you want at the bottom of
the section.)

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others
in order to get the team an A?**

Answer: Generally we would like to all have equal contributions, but if deemed 
necessary based on outside circumstances, a slight shift in workload may be 
discussed within the team (as long as the entire team understands and learns 
from this experience to benefit themselves in the future).

**How will you use the in-class time?**

Answer: We will try to make the most of our in-class time by getting work done,
discussing the tasks at hand, and helping each other better understand the 
concepts presented in the work.

**How often will you meet outside of class?**

Answer: Our goal is to meet as needed, with a minimum of two or three meetings.
We may adjust the number of meetings later if we think we need to meet more often.

**How will work be divided among team members?**

Answer: The team members will keep track of the division of work through a 
personal Discord server in which we will work together and as tasks as we see fit.

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

Answer: Ideally, all members of the team will pull their own weight within the group.
However, if one or more team members are not contributing the necessary amount of effort, the
team will meet and discuss this with all the members. Further action would be taken as we see fit.

**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Answer: For this lab we have a discord server we are all in, within said discord server we will
create a text channel where we will keep track of each member's tasks and progress.
